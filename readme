# Quiz Game with Machine Learning

This project is a simple quiz game that asks users multiple-choice questions and keeps track of the score. It uses a machine learning model to predict the difficulty level of each question and provides feedback based on the user's performance.

## Features

- Multiple-choice quiz with random questions
- Machine learning model to predict question difficulty (`easy` or `hard`)
- Feedback based on the user's total score after answering five questions
- Handles invalid input gracefully, prompting the user to re-answer the question

## Machine Learning

A Random Forest classifier is used to predict the difficulty of questions based on the length of the question text. The dataset includes columns for questions, options, and answers. The difficulty is predicted as `easy` or `hard`, depending on the question length.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
- Random Forest classifier
- CountVectorizer for text vectorization

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install the packages using:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
